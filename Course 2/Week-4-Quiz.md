Q1: The diagram for traditional programming had Rules and Data In, but what came out?
A1: Answers

Q2: Why does the DNN for Fashion MNIST have 10 output neurons?
A2: The dataset has 10 classes

Q3: What is a Convolution?
A3: A technique to extract features from an image

Q4: Applying Convolutions on top of a DNN will have what impact on training?
A4: It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!

Q5: What method on an ImageGenerator is used to normalize the image?
A5: rescale

Q6: When using Image Augmentation with the ImageDataGenerator, what happens to your raw image data on-disk.
A6: Nothing

Q7: Can you use Image augmentation with Transfer Learning?
A7: Yes. It's pre-trained layers that are frozen. So you can augment your images as you train the bottom layers of the DNN with them

Q8: When training for multiple classes what is the Class Mode for Image Augmentation?
A8: class_mode='categorical'
