Q1: Using Image Generator, how do you label images?
A1: It’s based on the directory the image is contained in

Q2: What method on the Image Generator is used to normalize the image?
A2: rescale

Q3: How did we specify the training size for the images?
A3: The target_size parameter on the training generator

Q4: When we specify the input_shape to be (300, 300, 3), what does that mean?
A4: Every Image will be 300x300 pixels, with 3 bytes to define color

Q5: If your training data is close to 1.000 accuracy, but your validation data isn’t, what’s the risk here?
A5: You’re overfitting on your training data

Q6: Convolutional Neural Networks are better for classifying images like horses and humans because:
A6: All of the above

Q7: After reducing the size of the images, the training results were different. Why?
A7: There was less information in the images
