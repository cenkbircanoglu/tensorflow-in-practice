Q1: What is a Convolution?
A1: A technique to isolate features in images

Q2: What is a Pooling?
A2: A technique to reduce the information in an image while maintaining features

Q3: How do Convolutions improve image recognition?
A3: They isolate features in images

Q4: After passing a 3x3 filter over a 28x28 image, how big will the output be?
A4: 26x26

Q5: After max pooling a 26x26 image with a 2x2 filter, how big will the output be?
A5: 13x13

Q6: Applying Convolutions on top of our Deep neural network will make training:
A6: It depends on many factors. It might make your training faster or slower, and a poorly designed Convolutional layer may even be less efficient than a plain DNN!
